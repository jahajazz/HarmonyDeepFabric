So not controversial at all, this passage in the Torah. And so this particular rule that's being made in the. In the first six verses of Exodus is for a situation where someone has been in a period of indentured servitude, so they've been working for and part of a household for some period of time to pay off a debt, and they come to the end of their term of service, but they like the household and the family, and they want to stay on. There were strict rules about how long you could keep someone in slavery and all of these things that are outlined in the rest of the chapter. But so if a person voluntarily says, you know, I rather like being the tutor or nanny for your children, and I want to stay, you know, I feel like I'm part of the family. There was a provision to do that. And so there is a ritual described here for what you do with that person who has decided they want to stay permanently as part of the household. And so I'll read Exodus 21, verses 5 and 6. But if the slave plainly says, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever. There's not a way to get around the fact that it says that he will bring him to the gods.\nIn the Hebrew, there's a definite article. So the word the. So you can't say, bring him to God.\nIt's the gods. And St. Jerome translated this just woodenly literally. It's. If you look in The Vulgate. He has deists. It's just the plural of God. Bring him to the gods. He just translated it directly from the Hebrew. The Greek is interesting because the Greek says that you should bring him before the court of God.\nRight. And it's not the word judgment seat. It's the. It's the word. It's where we get the word criterion, actually. It's criterion.\nAnd it means a law court. It means, like the actual court.\nYeah. So it's talking about, like, the counsel of God, basically.\nLet me add one. One little note before we do that. I don't want to leave people hanging with there.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer clarifies the significance of the plural term 'the gods,' indicating a communal aspect of authority in the ritual. It suggests that the act of bringing the servant before 'the gods' is not just a personal commitment but also a recognition of a broader community and divine oversight, which enriches the understanding of authority in the context of servitude.\nSources: Fr Stephen De Young@00:54\n\nIn the Hebrew, there's a definite article.

Yes.\nSame word, but tsava. OT is the OT ending is a feminine plural ending in Hebrew. Tzava means to be many, to team, to be many. And so that in a nominal form, in the plural means like big groups or hosts. Lord of hosts is how the King James Old Testament.\nYeah, it gets complicated because the Septuagints in different ways. But yeah, it's the same kind of idea. God of the powers, the hymn, the Trisaghian, the Holy, holy, holy Lord Sabaoth is being sung by the angels. And it's a way of the angels expressing and worshiping him as their God.\nThat's a way we don't always think about it. And that's why there's a similar phrase also in our memorial prayers, which is actually taken directly from the Book of Jubilees. A different piece of Enochic literature where the prayer begins, O God of spirits and of all flesh.\nFather yeah. Before we freak everybody out, let me give one more proviso in terms of why we're freaking everybody out.\nOne might wonder why you would do this to people. The reality is that there are certain things that are just in the scriptures, whether we as sort of modern Christians with a materialist bent kind of are comfortable with that or not. And they have a way of speaking. And from the Victorian era through until probably the 1950s or so in America, there was sort of a gentleman's agreement that we would all sort of pick paper over these things in our English translations and not push on them too. Not push on them too hard so that we could all be comfortable. And the problem is that if we want to continue to do that as Orthodox Christians, we're setting ourselves up for a problem with future generations. Because while I may not want to get into, say, a passage in the Old Testament that talks about human sacrifice, the atheist roommate of my son or daughter, the atheist professor of my son or daughter is going to have no such qualms about bringing up all of these things.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer explains the origin of the phrase 'God of spirits and of all flesh,' linking it to a specific scriptural source.

And so these, these spiritual beings can be called gods. In English, we do it with a small G, but you know, they aren't using capitals in, in Greek can be talked about that way because either on the one side, God has chosen to share his rule and his dominion with them. And so with, with angelic beings, they are sharing in and reigning with God and God is exercising his rule and his dominion and his power and his authority through them, graciously sharing it with them, or on the other side, on the more demonic side, because humans, in their rebellion and sin, have elevated these spiritual beings and chosen to worship and serve them and become enslaved to them. And so they are functioning as gods in that sense.\nAnd I know, I think it may be even our next show in a fortnight, we're going to go deeper into this. But this is a big part of what's going on. When the fathers talk about theosis and talk about us becoming gods, that's directly connected to the idea in the New Testament of Christ exercising his rule and authority through the saints in glory, that they rule and reign with him and share in his dominion. But we'll get more into that.\nNo, in fact, it's even more flexible than Theos.\nElohim is used to refer to any spiritual being. So it's used to refer to God, the true God. It's used to refer to the gods, the same word, Elohim. And now to really freak people out. Oh, yeah, I have a couple of examples where it's even used for deceased humans. The first one and the one that might freak people out less in 1st Samuel 28, verse 13.\nIf you're in your. If you're in your orthodox study Bible.\nThis is when Saul, near the end of his reign as king and his disobedience, goes to consult with the witch or the medium at Endor, not the one with the Ewoks, oh, man, the city, Palestine, and asks her to sum it up, the spirit of Samuel. And there's this moment in verse 13 where she's kind of seemingly maybe a little surprised at how well it worked and because she starts freaking out. And verse 13 says the king said to her, do not be Afraid. What do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a God coming up out of the earth. So. And then that turns out to be Samuel's spirit. And he speaks.\nRight. So he's. The term Elohim is used to apply to him. And, you know, the. The biblical author is not saying that. That the prophet Samuel was another person of the Trinity or that he was a polytheist and.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer clarifies the flexibility of the term 'Elohim' in scripture, indicating that it encompasses a range of spiritual beings, including God and other entities.
