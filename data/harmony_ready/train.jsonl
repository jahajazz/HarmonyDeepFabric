So it's used to refer to God, the true God. It's used to refer to the gods, the same word, Elohim. And now to really freak people out. Oh, yeah, I have a couple of examples where it's even used for deceased humans. The first one and the one that might freak people out less in 1st Samuel 28, verse 13.\nIf you're in your. If you're in your orthodox study Bible.\nThis is when Saul, near the end of his reign as king and his disobedience, goes to consult with the witch or the medium at Endor, not the one with the Ewoks, oh, man, the city, Palestine, and asks her to sum it up, the spirit of Samuel. And there's this moment in verse 13 where she's kind of seemingly maybe a little surprised at how well it worked and because she starts freaking out. And verse 13 says the king said to her, do not be Afraid. What do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a God coming up out of the earth. So. And then that turns out to be Samuel's spirit. And he speaks.\nRight. So he's. The term Elohim is used to apply to him. And, you know, the. The biblical author is not saying that. That the prophet Samuel was another person of the Trinity or that he was a polytheist and.\nThe prophet Samuel now lived on Mount Olympus or something. Yeah, that's not. That's not what he's going for. The word is just flexible to include that now.\nAnd now the one that will be most controversial, that I kind of warned you about, but we're gonna go there.\nAnd this is in Exodus 21, verses 1 through 6, which is in the context of laws governing slavery. So not controversial at all, this passage in the Torah. And so this particular rule that's being made in the. In the first six verses of Exodus is for a situation where someone has been in a period of indentured servitude, so they've been working for and part of a household for some period of time to pay off a debt, and they come to the end of their term of service, but they like the household and the family, and they want to stay on. There were strict rules about how long you could keep someone in slavery and all of these things that are outlined in the rest of the chapter. But so if a person voluntarily says, you know, I rather like being the tutor or nanny for your children, and I want to stay, you know, I feel like I'm part of the family. There was a provision to do that. And so there is a ritual described here for what you do with that person who has decided they want to stay permanently as part of the household. And so I'll read Exodus 21, verses 5 and 6. But if the slave plainly says, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever. There's not a way to get around the fact that it says that he will bring him to the gods.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer clarifies the flexibility of the term 'Elohim' in biblical texts, emphasizing that it can refer to various spiritual beings without implying polytheism or a misunderstanding of the Trinity.

Religion just evolved. And that of course, takes the idea that God revealed himself to humans out of the picture, which is why we would want to have that theory if we're atheists. And so it's important that we not only say, well, look, these categories aren't ancient and aren't original, but that we say that whole taxonomy doesn't work. And a couple of things real quick that refute it are. Number one, it depends on the people who put together the Hebrew Bible being both incredibly sophisticated editors and writers of, of deep theological truths and being complete imbeciles. Because while they were doing all the editing and while they were changing all this stuff to make it look like they were always monotheists, they just missed all these passages. Oops, whoops.\nWhoops. We left all this polytheistic stuff in there. Our bad. So that's a problem. And then the other, the thing to me that really blows it out of the water is that the plural form of gods, talking about gods in the plural, is actually more common in the Dead Sea Scrolls than it is in the Old Testament. And the Dead Sea Scrolls are written right before and during the time of Christ.\nSo they clearly hadn't evolved in their language. They were still talking about. About a plurality of gods. And one last note on this question, hopefully that's thorough enough. But one last note on this question, because I think this is important, is what we mean when we say that there is one true God.\nMeans to be a true God. Because I think what we hear as modern American Christians when you hear true God is, oh, well, he's the one that exists. And the other ones are fake.\nThe other ones are made up. Right. But remember what we were saying earlier in our discussion. The idea of being God is the idea of exercising authority and dominion and reign. And so God is the one true God. He is the one who truly holds all authority and power and dominion over the entire creation. Anyone else who has any authority or power or dominion has received it from above, has received it from him, or they don't have it.\nYeah, right. And that's why we reiterate that in the creed that Christ is true God. Right. It's not just that he's God. That he's divine. Right. But. But that he is. He is true God. He exercises the same authority.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer clarifies the theological significance of the term 'true God' by emphasizing that it refers to the one who holds ultimate authority and dominion.

And I think also we're going to see some interesting discussion in the comments section and I really encourage everybody to get it. Like I said, it looks really thick, but it's very nice to read because it's kind of a in between a conversation and a scholarly book. It's not just totally conversational, but it's also not. It doesn't have all these footnotes and it's not constantly. It's not technical. And so it's very much. It follows the pattern of what it's talking about, which is the idea of beauty and the idea of narrative and pattern and how this is related to communion and relationship. And so the fact that it's an interview also participates in its meaning. So I looking forward to diving into it even more and check out Hellenic College, everybody, for yourself, for your kids, because we need good places to learn.

So thank you and I will see you soon.\nAs we plunge further and further into this pandemic, some people have noticed that a comic book in 2017 published by Belgian authors called Asterix and the Chariot Race has a strange character in it called Coronavirus. It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

Who among the sons of God is like Yahweh, a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones and awesome above all who are around him.

Well, and to even add to that, it goes on in verse 10 to talk about God crushing a sea monster and throwing its carcass to the earth.\nBehemoth. Yeah.\nBut so then Exodus 15:11, you know, who is like you? Oh, Yahweh among the gods. Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome and glorious deeds, doing wonders. This isn't comparing God, the God of Israel to imaginary characters.\nThat, that wouldn't be a big praise. Like, who in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is like God?\nLike, I mean, okay, but what does that prove? Right? Exodus 18:11, three chapters later.

Deuteronomy 10:17. For, for Yahweh, your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who is not partial and takes no bribe. And Psalm 95. 3 is similar. It's for Yahweh is a great God and a great king above all gods. So when we see this language, God of gods, it's not just a superlative, it's saying that the other gods have the God of Israel as their God.\nRight. And especially when it's disambiguated as the great king above all gods.\nThat it's not that they don't exist, it's that he's. He's their king. And so what's going on here is a couple of things. The, the first is that the word God is just being used to refer to spiritual beings. It's hard to reflect in English we usually do that by using a capital letter for God and then a lowercase God or gods for these other beings. But the reason for that, and the fathers actually, when they talk about the word, the Greek word theos and what it means, they really get into the idea that it's kind of a verbal idea, even though it's a noun.\nThe word is something that God does. He is God. It has to do with his, like godding. It has to do with his dominion and his rule and his power.\nAnd some examples of this that might help with that in, in the New Testament, for example, St. Paul refers to the devil as the God of this present age.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This response explains that the term 'God of gods' signifies a hierarchy where the God of Israel is recognized as the supreme authority over other spiritual beings, thus providing a theological framework for understanding divine supremacy.\nSources: Fr Stephen De Young@00:44\n\nWhen we see this language, God of gods, it's not just a superlative, it's saying that the other gods have the God of Israel as their God."}]}

You're saying we need Russian oligarchs, Is that what you're saying?\nThere you go. You prefer Italian bankers. That's hilarious. No, I agree, I agree. And I think one of the things that needs to happen, and I think this kind of falls back in your court as well. And not just your court, but all the seminaries in the United States is also the future priests need to have that part of their education. This is what I believe. I think that part of their education has to be a capacity to understand the importance of liturgical art and the capacity it has to affect Our being, especially in a modern world of strip malls and electric lines and all this horrible, ugly stuff, it seems like if the clergy, as we get more clergy, if the young clergy is at least attentive to that and cares and know that it's important, then we're slowly going to. It's not going to happen, you know, tomorrow, but we're slowly going to build a culture of beauty back into, you know, because we. We have to also understand the madness that we're coming out of. You know, we're coming out of the communist regimes were coming out of the fascist states, were coming out of a church. The Orthodox Church was beaten to the ground. And so it's not just everything is now taking life again. And so the arts also have to find their place in that and in America, in a world of practicality and in a world of budgets and thinking in terms of the bottom line, it's. It seems like it's a tougher step to take to really consider the liturgical arts as part of what we need to bring into our communities as well.\nBut I think also the easy accessibility of the cheap option is also hurting us in the sense that one of the things that I recommend people is to don't get everything right away. Everybody, they want Hagia Sophia right away. And so if you want that, then of course, then you'll get prints all over the church and you'll get these massive prints that you just glue on the wall and everything. Because it's. Because you can get all the icons or you can buy a series of all the icons and it'll cost you a few hundred dollars and you're done. And so you have to think more simply that we need to start get one good icon and if you're going to buy a painted icon, get a good one and then just slowly build from there instead of going all out and getting all the cheap stuff.\nAnd that's a great thing about understanding complex systems as well, is that you realize that there's an actual natural process by which ugly things get eliminated and beautiful things get kept. You know, it's like when they decide which building they're gonna make a parking lot out of in the city, they're not gonna destroy that, you know, 300, 200 year old Neo Gothic church. They're going to, you know, get that ugly building, that ugly block of cement. I say that, but it's happening in Europe, sadly as well they are. Because the cost of maintaining these buildings is difficult. There are some churches in Europe that are getting bulldozed, right?\nYeah, I agree. I agree. And I think that we need to see that also, that acts of beauty, just like acts of love in an interpersonal way, that it is like these little stones that fall into a pond, and you don't know the ramifications of what they have. And so we need to kind of just advance. You know, I just make one icon at a time, and I send them out into these families, into these parishes. And it's. To me, it's a great joy to know that I'm gonna be. That I'm actually participating in someone's life through this act. I'm creating something which is part. You know, I'm communing with them in a way by giving them an object that they will have in their prayer corner that they'll partner, give to their niece who's getting baptized, or whatever it is they're going to do with this icon, that it's not just an object of consumption, it's not just something that you consume, but it's something that you participate in.\nYeah. And that's one of the things that once you understand hierarchy properly, you understand that there's always a fringe. You actually shouldn't get rid of the fringe. It's there, it has a problem, it's problematic, but it's not going away. It's just part of how reality unfolds. There's a narthex, there's a fringe, there are gargoyles on the outside of the church. It's just part of the pattern. You just don't want to confuse which place things have. Right, right.\nAll right, Dr. Timothy, this is a great conversation. I'm going to finish reading your book and I'm hoping that if you want to, I would like to engage on some other aspects of it once I get through. And. And I think also we're going to see some interesting discussion in the comments section and I really encourage everybody to get it. Like I said, it looks really thick, but it's very nice to read because it's kind of a in between a conversation and a scholarly book. It's not just totally conversational, but it's also not. It doesn't have all these footnotes and it's not constantly. It's not technical. And so it's very much. It follows the pattern of what it's talking about, which is the idea of beauty and the idea of narrative and pattern and how this is related to communion and relationship. And so the fact that it's an interview also participates in its meaning. So I looking forward to diving into it even more and check out Hellenic College, everybody, for yourself, for your kids, because we need good places to learn. And with Dr. Timothy there, you know that it's going in a good direction. At least that's what I think for my kids.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This response illustrates how acts of beauty can have profound and far-reaching effects, similar to acts of love.

We left all this polytheistic stuff in there. Our bad. So that's a problem.

It's just we haven't been taught to sort of think in that way and think in that direction. So our orthodox tradition has sort of preserved all of these data points, has preserved all of this information and all of this context for us. It's just we haven't necessarily, as English speaking orthodox Christians in the west, sort of fully appropriated how to connect those dots and how it all fits together and what the connective tissue is between these different things, between this biblical passage and this icon and this hymn.\nIt's basically the belief that matter and energy and their co relationships and interactions are all that exists.\nThere's no demons, no God.

So not controversial at all, this passage in the Torah. And so this particular rule that's being made in the. In the first six verses of Exodus is for a situation where someone has been in a period of indentured servitude, so they've been working for and part of a household for some period of time to pay off a debt, and they come to the end of their term of service, but they like the household and the family, and they want to stay on. There were strict rules about how long you could keep someone in slavery and all of these things that are outlined in the rest of the chapter. But so if a person voluntarily says, you know, I rather like being the tutor or nanny for your children, and I want to stay, you know, I feel like I'm part of the family. There was a provision to do that. And so there is a ritual described here for what you do with that person who has decided they want to stay permanently as part of the household. And so I'll read Exodus 21, verses 5 and 6. But if the slave plainly says, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever. There's not a way to get around the fact that it says that he will bring him to the gods.\nIn the Hebrew, there's a definite article. So the word the. So you can't say, bring him to God.\nIt's the gods. And St. Jerome translated this just woodenly literally. It's. If you look in The Vulgate. He has deists. It's just the plural of God. Bring him to the gods. He just translated it directly from the Hebrew. The Greek is interesting because the Greek says that you should bring him before the court of God.\nRight. And it's not the word judgment seat. It's the. It's the word. It's where we get the word criterion, actually. It's criterion.\nAnd it means a law court. It means, like the actual court.\nYeah.

It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

Religion just evolved. And that of course, takes the idea that God revealed himself to humans out of the picture, which is why we would want to have that theory if we're atheists. And so it's important that we not only say, well, look, these categories aren't ancient and aren't original, but that we say that whole taxonomy doesn't work. And a couple of things real quick that refute it are. Number one, it depends on the people who put together the Hebrew Bible being both incredibly sophisticated editors and writers of, of deep theological truths and being complete imbeciles. Because while they were doing all the editing and while they were changing all this stuff to make it look like they were always monotheists, they just missed all these passages.

And we're seeing everybody do that. It's a weird mix of frightening. And in a way, we're happy that technology is permitting us to do this, to even have this discussion and to do this. And I just have the fear that we're creating permanent patterns. We'll see, hopefully we're not, hopefully, that as these, as this wave, kind of, we ride this wave, then we will be able to reconnect in more direct ways. The danger is that it's so convenient that there might be a lot of residue of this kind of weird, disconnected connection that we. That we're setting up.\nWell, interesting. Take it, take it as. Take it as a challenge, for sure. And so how do you. Because, you know, I'm an icon carver, and so obviously my interest in this question of beauty and the question of the relationship between the very pattern of reality and in these, These systems that we create, that we engage in. I'd like to get a bit of your sense of, let's say, the state of liturgical art as you kind of see it, and maybe also how you see the capacity for Orthodox liturgical art to affect our culture, our modern culture. Right now. Big question.\nRight, yeah. You're saying we need Russian oligarchs, Is that what you're saying?\nThere you go. You prefer Italian bankers. That's hilarious. No, I agree, I agree. And I think one of the things that needs to happen, and I think this kind of falls back in your court as well. And not just your court, but all the seminaries in the United States is also the future priests need to have that part of their education. This is what I believe. I think that part of their education has to be a capacity to understand the importance of liturgical art and the capacity it has to affect Our being, especially in a modern world of strip malls and electric lines and all this horrible, ugly stuff, it seems like if the clergy, as we get more clergy, if the young clergy is at least attentive to that and cares and know that it's important, then we're slowly going to. It's not going to happen, you know, tomorrow, but we're slowly going to build a culture of beauty back into, you know, because we. We have to also understand the madness that we're coming out of. You know, we're coming out of the communist regimes were coming out of the fascist states, were coming out of a church. The Orthodox Church was beaten to the ground. And so it's not just everything is now taking life again. And so the arts also have to find their place in that and in America, in a world of practicality and in a world of budgets and thinking in terms of the bottom line, it's. It seems like it's a tougher step to take to really consider the liturgical arts as part of what we need to bring into our communities as well.\nBut I think also the easy accessibility of the cheap option is also hurting us in the sense that one of the things that I recommend people is to don't get everything right away. Everybody, they want Hagia Sophia right away. And so if you want that, then of course, then you'll get prints all over the church and you'll get these massive prints that you just glue on the wall and everything. Because it's. Because you can get all the icons or you can buy a series of all the icons and it'll cost you a few hundred dollars and you're done. And so you have to think more simply that we need to start get one good icon and if you're going to buy a painted icon, get a good one and then just slowly build from there instead of going all out and getting all the cheap stuff.\nAnd that's a great thing about understanding complex systems as well, is that you realize that there's an actual natural process by which ugly things get eliminated and beautiful things get kept. You know, it's like when they decide which building they're gonna make a parking lot out of in the city, they're not gonna destroy that, you know, 300, 200 year old Neo Gothic church. They're going to, you know, get that ugly building, that ugly block of cement. I say that, but it's happening in Europe, sadly as well they are. Because the cost of maintaining these buildings is difficult. There are some churches in Europe that are getting bulldozed, right?\nYeah, I agree. I agree. And I think that we need to see that also, that acts of beauty, just like acts of love in an interpersonal way, that it is like these little stones that fall into a pond, and you don't know the ramifications of what they have. And so we need to kind of just advance. You know, I just make one icon at a time, and I send them out into these families, into these parishes. And it's. To me, it's a great joy to know that I'm gonna be. That I'm actually participating in someone's life through this act. I'm creating something which is part. You know, I'm communing with them in a way by giving them an object that they will have in their prayer corner that they'll partner, give to their niece who's getting baptized, or whatever it is they're going to do with this icon, that it's not just an object of consumption, it's not just something that you consume, but it's something that you participate in.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer addresses the question by emphasizing the need for clergy to recognize and integrate beauty through liturgical art in their communities.

So it's used to refer to God, the true God. It's used to refer to the gods, the same word, Elohim. And now to really freak people out. Oh, yeah, I have a couple of examples where it's even used for deceased humans. The first one and the one that might freak people out less in 1st Samuel 28, verse 13.\nIf you're in your. If you're in your orthodox study Bible.\nThis is when Saul, near the end of his reign as king and his disobedience, goes to consult with the witch or the medium at Endor, not the one with the Ewoks, oh, man, the city, Palestine, and asks her to sum it up, the spirit of Samuel. And there's this moment in verse 13 where she's kind of seemingly maybe a little surprised at how well it worked and because she starts freaking out. And verse 13 says the king said to her, do not be Afraid. What do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a God coming up out of the earth. So. And then that turns out to be Samuel's spirit. And he speaks.\nRight. So he's. The term Elohim is used to apply to him. And, you know, the. The biblical author is not saying that. That the prophet Samuel was another person of the Trinity or that he was a polytheist and.\nThe prophet Samuel now lived on Mount Olympus or something. Yeah, that's not. That's not what he's going for. The word is just flexible to include that now.\nAnd now the one that will be most controversial, that I kind of warned you about, but we're gonna go there.\nAnd this is in Exodus 21, verses 1 through 6, which is in the context of laws governing slavery. So not controversial at all, this passage in the Torah. And so this particular rule that's being made in the. In the first six verses of Exodus is for a situation where someone has been in a period of indentured servitude, so they've been working for and part of a household for some period of time to pay off a debt, and they come to the end of their term of service, but they like the household and the family, and they want to stay on. There were strict rules about how long you could keep someone in slavery and all of these things that are outlined in the rest of the chapter. But so if a person voluntarily says, you know, I rather like being the tutor or nanny for your children, and I want to stay, you know, I feel like I'm part of the family. There was a provision to do that. And so there is a ritual described here for what you do with that person who has decided they want to stay permanently as part of the household. And so I'll read Exodus 21, verses 5 and 6. But if the slave plainly says, I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever. There's not a way to get around the fact that it says that he will bring him to the gods.\nBase your answer solely on the cited transcript text."},{"role":"assistant","content":"This answer illustrates the ritual associated with a servant's choice to remain with a household, highlighting the deep personal connections that can form in such relationships.

I've done an exorcist. I've done an exorcism on a house to tease everyone.\nWell, it depends on your Bible. Are you Ethiopian?\nSo, Lord of Spirits is one of several titles that's ascribed to God in the Enochic literature, which is the various books of Enoch, as well as other books like the Apocalypse of Abraham and the Book of Jubilees and a few other texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Yes.\nSame word, but tsava. OT is the OT ending is a feminine plural ending in Hebrew. Tzava means to be many, to team, to be many.
