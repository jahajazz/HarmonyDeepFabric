It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

I'm going to finish reading your book and I'm hoping that if you want to, I would like to engage on some other aspects of it once I get through. And. And I think also we're going to see some interesting discussion in the comments section and I really encourage everybody to get it. Like I said, it looks really thick, but it's very nice to read because it's kind of a in between a conversation and a scholarly book. It's not just totally conversational, but it's also not. It doesn't have all these footnotes and it's not constantly. It's not technical. And so it's very much. It follows the pattern of what it's talking about, which is the idea of beauty and the idea of narrative and pattern and how this is related to communion and relationship. And so the fact that it's an interview also participates in its meaning. So I looking forward to diving into it even more and check out Hellenic College, everybody, for yourself, for your kids, because we need good places to learn.

It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

I'm going to finish reading your book and I'm hoping that if you want to, I would like to engage on some other aspects of it once I get through. And. And I think also we're going to see some interesting discussion in the comments section and I really encourage everybody to get it. Like I said, it looks really thick, but it's very nice to read because it's kind of a in between a conversation and a scholarly book. It's not just totally conversational, but it's also not. It doesn't have all these footnotes and it's not constantly. It's not technical. And so it's very much. It follows the pattern of what it's talking about, which is the idea of beauty and the idea of narrative and pattern and how this is related to communion and relationship. And so the fact that it's an interview also participates in its meaning. So I looking forward to diving into it even more and check out Hellenic College, everybody, for yourself, for your kids, because we need good places to learn.

But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

I mean, most of the stuff we're reading from the old, but we're showing, you know, if you look at this, if you look at the scriptures folks closely, you'll see that the scriptures are taking these things very seriously and not saying this is some kind of metaphor or again, made up stories. Like, one of the problems with the way that the modern world tends to look at ancient religion is they'll say, oh, well, they notice that there's lightning in the sky, or they notice that there's earthquakes, or they notice that the Nile floods. And so they came up with some kind of explanation for it. And eventually that explanation evolved into believing in some kind of God of lightning or what. No, that's, that's not the way that the Bible depicts this stuff. And it's not the way that the people on the ground understood what they were doing. Right. That's not. They attest to the fact that they had encounters with these spiritual beings. And the Bible takes them very, very seriously. Again, God standing in the midst of the gods, God judging gods.

I think that part of their education has to be a capacity to understand the importance of liturgical art and the capacity it has to affect Our being, especially in a modern world of strip malls and electric lines and all this horrible, ugly stuff, it seems like if the clergy, as we get more clergy, if the young clergy is at least attentive to that and cares and know that it's important, then we're slowly going to. It's not going to happen, you know, tomorrow, but we're slowly going to build a culture of beauty back into, you know, because we. We have to also understand the madness that we're coming out of. You know, we're coming out of the communist regimes were coming out of the fascist states, were coming out of a church. The Orthodox Church was beaten to the ground. And so it's not just everything is now taking life again. And so the arts also have to find their place in that and in America, in a world of practicality and in a world of budgets and thinking in terms of the bottom line, it's.

Because you can get all the icons or you can buy a series of all the icons and it'll cost you a few hundred dollars and you're done.

They're going to, you know, get that ugly building, that ugly block of cement. I say that, but it's happening in Europe, sadly as well they are.

To me, it's a great joy to know that I'm gonna be. That I'm actually participating in someone's life through this act. I'm creating something which is part. You know, I'm communing with them in a way by giving them an object that they will have in their prayer corner that they'll partner, give to their niece who's getting baptized, or whatever it is they're going to do with this icon, that it's not just an object of consumption, it's not just something that you consume, but it's something that you participate in."},{"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","start":3173.48,"end":3198.31,"text":"Yeah.

You prefer Italian bankers. That's hilarious. No, I agree, I agree. And I think one of the things that needs to happen, and I think this kind of falls back in your court as well. And not just your court, but all the seminaries in the United States is also the future priests need to have that part of their education. This is what I believe. I think that part of their education has to be a capacity to understand the importance of liturgical art and the capacity it has to affect Our being, especially in a modern world of strip malls and electric lines and all this horrible, ugly stuff, it seems like if the clergy, as we get more clergy, if the young clergy is at least attentive to that and cares and know that it's important, then we're slowly going to. It's not going to happen, you know, tomorrow, but we're slowly going to build a culture of beauty back into, you know, because we. We have to also understand the madness that we're coming out of. You know, we're coming out of the communist regimes were coming out of the fascist states, were coming out of a church. The Orthodox Church was beaten to the ground. And so it's not just everything is now taking life again. And so the arts also have to find their place in that and in America, in a world of practicality and in a world of budgets and thinking in terms of the bottom line, it's. It seems like it's a tougher step to take to really consider the liturgical arts as part of what we need to bring into our communities as well."},{"speaker":"Dr. Timothy Patitsas","start":2748.99,"end":2861.75,"text":"You know, Jane Jacobs, sort of bring her into everything, but she's just so great. She said beauty is not to be had for the asking. You try to build beautiful things, but sometimes it's not evident for a generation or so whether you've hit the ball out of the park or. Or kind of. Kind of whiffed. And so it's. You know, it's. There is some dimension of which it really is a miracle when some. Whenever anything beautiful gets made. But she also. She also. And I think Alexander was like. And Wendell Berry too. I think probably the answer for a lot of churches is to. Is to build a really beautiful small chapel somewhere, because that does not have the same, you know, the same complications of fire escapes and whatever. Whatever in your main church. And if you're. If your parish isn't ready financially or educationally to build its parish church the right way, at least if these small side chapels off in the country or even just across the street or in a different part of the city can be done, well, that's enough. I think that should be counted as a giant victory. I mean, enough for now. A parish priest is essentially. I mean, besides everything else that he is, he's the mayor of a small village, and he's got to keep that community together. As you said, quoting Maximus, to the extent that it's able, it's possible. I think a beauty first way is accepting of limitations.

Everybody, they want Hagia Sophia right away. And so if you want that, then of course, then you'll get prints all over the church and you'll get these massive prints that you just glue on the wall and everything. Because it's. Because you can get all the icons or you can buy a series of all the icons and it'll cost you a few hundred dollars and you're done.

I mean, I certainly know bad art when I see it and bad architecture, but I think as I've gotten older, I've gotten a lot less critical and judgmental of it.

They're going to, you know, get that ugly building, that ugly block of cement. I say that, but it's happening in Europe, sadly as well they are.

He saw that in a bottom line culture that nothing was sacred and nothing was going to withstand that. And his answer was a kind of violent rejection of just Everything that had led up to that point. My point is that just the quality of our own. If you can fall in love with a beautiful account of the life of St. Seraphim, of Seraphim, you have changed imperceptibly and invisibly. The world situation. You're different. And that's going to radiate out and change the world.

And so we need to kind of just advance. You know, I just make one icon at a time, and I send them out into these families, into these parishes. And it's. To me, it's a great joy to know that I'm gonna be. That I'm actually participating in someone's life through this act. I'm creating something which is part. You know, I'm communing with them in a way by giving them an object that they will have in their prayer corner that they'll partner, give to their niece who's getting baptized, or whatever it is they're going to do with this icon, that it's not just an object of consumption, it's not just something that you consume, but it's something that you participate in."},{"speaker":"Dr. Timothy Patitsas","start":3110.43,"end":3172.84,"text":"Yes.

And he took him a while to understand the question, and then he just laughed because he understood that these insubstantial things, they serve their purpose. They have their place.

Hi, this is Father Evan Armitas, priest at St. Spirit on Greek Orthodox Church in Loveland, Colorado, and the host of the Ancient Faith Radio Sunday Night Call In Show Orthodoxy Live. I am pleased to announce today the release of my first book for Ancient Faith Publishing titled Toolkit for Spiritual A Practical Guide to Prayer, Fasting and Almsgiving. It seeks to provide a guide to the three basic and primary disciplines of orthodox spirituality. Through these disciplines, Christ opened for us a path that frees us from the disordered way of life that has become normal for many even though their hearts and minds minds tell them otherwise. Please join me in exploring the three legged stool of orthodox spiritual practice, Prayer, fasting and almsgiving. Books now available@store.ancientfaith.com and the title once again is Toolkit for Spiritual Growth. I look forward to sharing it with you. God bless. We're back now with the Lord of Spirits with Father Andrew, Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung. If you have a question, call now at 855-237-2346.

I think he just nailed it. So if you know Steve, tell him that he did a fine job. Thank you, Steve. I hope that you're listening. So, yeah, so let's talk about the word gods as it's used in the Bible because that I think is going to be one of the ways that people are going to hear stuff that we're going to say on this show and it's going to sound weird to them and they're going to want wonder if we're actually Christians because we're saying, well, I believe in lots of gods actually, you know, but so let's talk about why as a Christian, you can and should believe in many gods if that doesn't weird you out too much. So let's begin by talking about how the word gods is actually used in the Bible. And this is one of the ways that sometimes translation is hiding something from us. Right. So we have an English translation that might use other kinds of words, but lurking underneath is a Hebrew word or a Greek word that actually is saying gods, but it doesn't get translated as gods in English.

Well. And as I said earlier, I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick, and I work full time for Ancient Faith Ministries as their chief content officer, a position I started just from five, six weeks ago, actually. I did serve in parish ministry for 13 years, including 11 as a pastor. And one of the kind of fun things that Father Stephen and I share is that we actually have both had the same job, although I had it for just two years and he had it for eight. But we are both the former assistant pastor of St. George Orthodox Cathedral in Charleston, West Virginia. So hello to any of you Charleston people out there who are currently listening to two of your former assistant pastors. But I'm super interested in this show because I think that there's so much about spiritual life that it's easy for us not just to miss, but to have kind of endless struggles with that we don't necessarily have to have. And we're going to talk about this a lot as we go, and of course not just in this episode, but it's going to be perennial issue. The sense that we have that, that the 3D world that we experience is kind of all we feel like we can access most of the time. Right. But as Christians, we want to access something beyond this. And it's very frustrating when you maybe reach out for God or the saints and you're like, well, where are you? What's going on? Right? And serving as a pastor for 11 years, this is a perennial issue. And I think, you know, any pastors that are out there listening to this, I'm sure you've had the same experience. But even just Christians, you know that we all have this difficulty because we're modern people living in a way of thinking and looking at the world that makes it difficult to access spiritual reality. And so my interest is pastoral. I mean, it's also just like, I like to geek out about this kind of stuff. But I think one of the important kind of disambiguations, to use your term, Father Stephen, to make here at the beginning, is that just to define one of the differences between the two of us is that you are an actual biblical scholar and maybe make you list off the languages that you read at some point. And I'm not. So I'm not. It's not like, you know, and now we have a panel of two experts in biblical scholarship ready to answer your question. That's not what this show is. So if you've read Father Stephen's blog, the Whole Counsel of God, you listen to his podcast, you know that he's studied this stuff very, very closely and has a lot of really in depth knowledge. He actually has a doctorate. Is it Biblical studies or New Testament? I'm trying to remember which."},{"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","start":396.02,"end":396.98,"text":"Biblical studies."},{"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","start":396.98,"end":423.57,"text":"Biblical studies. Okay. This is my PhD. Yeah, yeah. He actually has a PhD in this stuff. I super don't. Right. But you know, when we were first talking about this show, I said to Father Steven, I said, so like, how are we gonna make sure that this show isn't just you telling about the things, you know, and me sitting there saying, that's awesome, dude, you're awesome. And your response was something like, well, you're way more practical than I am. Right. You know, so."},{"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","start":423.73,"end":451.15,"text":"Yeah, yeah. Well, my original pitch was that you would read newspaper headlines and then I would explain how that relates to End Times prophecy, but you nixed that. And then, yeah, you are more practical and also much more of a professional broadcaster. So without you, this would just be the semi unending ramblings of a crazed nerd."},{"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","start":452.19,"end":699.01,"text":"Right. But I'll also say, so I think one of the things that you're going to hear as we go on this show is I want to be learning. Right. I've learned a lot from my friendship with Father Stephen and I'm trying to learn from a lot of other sources as well. I mean, Father Stephen sends me stuff all the time and it's great. And part of that is what we want to accomplish with this is that we're going to be in a learning process together and that being an orthodox Christian isn't about mastering a specific set of data. And now you've got it down and you're catechized and you're good to go. You know, when you get to the gates of heaven, they're going to check and make sure that you can answer all the catechetical Questions like, that's not the way that being a Christian actually works. And, you know, in the past few years, a lot of things have really kind of opened my eyes to whole parts of orthodox tradition that are there and often are staring us in the face, but that we're often not paying attention to. And I'll just give one example. Okay? So you're probably gonna hear us talk a lot about what we're gonna call spiritual geography, right? So where is paradise? Where is the underworld? You know, the mountain of God, Hades? Like, all this kind of stuff. Okay. And one of the things that. One of the teachings that's actually preserved in the Orthodox Church and has been handed down for many, many, many centuries, but that I. I've been an Orthodox Christian for over 20 years now that I never actually paid attention to. So if you had come up to me and said, does the church teach this? I would be like, I've never heard that. And one of those things is this teaching that St. John the Forerunner, John the Baptist, went to Hades to preach the coming of Christ. Now, you're not going to see that in the Bible, but it is a belief that is actually in orthodox tradition. And so I actually noticed this for the first time just a few years ago. And the funny thing is, it's actually kind of staring you in the face. It's referenced in lots of places, especially in our liturgical tradition. So, for instance, a couple weeks ago on the new calendar, we just celebrated the beheading of John the Baptist, that feast. And I had noticed that in the Apolitikian, which is kind of one of the main hymns for the feast, that it actually mentions that he goes to Hades to preach there. And I. I'd sung it for years, but I had never just taken notice of that particular phrase. It's in the Apolitikan. And so I started looking at other texts. And you know what? It's in the Kentuckian, too, the other main hymn for the day. And then I started looking at more and more, especially throughout the Manaen, which is the main set of festal texts for the feast. And it's everywhere. It's mentioned over and over that he goes to the underworld to preach to those in Hades. And so that's just one example of something that's right there in our tradition and kind of stick staring you in the face. But unless you're oriented towards paying attention to it, you're probably just going to kind of skip over it, not really even know that it's there. And so if I had to, if someone were to say to me, you know, say in a nutshell, what is this show about? It's about talking especially about those things that are right there in the Bible, right there in the church services, right there in the church fathers. But, but that maybe we've never noticed or we didn't know what to do with it so we just kind of skipped over it. Or maybe it was hidden behind a translation issue and we just didn't know because we don't read the original languages. And sometimes these are really kind of important issues, right. It's not just obscure little things like, oh, that's neat, you know, it's really important issues for your spiritual life. So I don't know, that's a much longer way of saying what my motivation is for doing this. So. But I think it's important for us to lay this stuff out at the beginning so that people get the idea. This is not a couple of professors teaching the class in demonology or angelology or any of that kind of stuff. That's not what's going on. But obviously we're going to be touching on a lot of those kinds of topics. Is there anything else that Father you wanted to add in terms of laying out what it is we're trying to accomplish with this particular show?"},{"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","start":700.18,"end":728.01,"text":"Well, just going along with what you were just saying that. And one of the questions that we will probably end up getting asked relatively frequently is sort of why people haven't heard this stuff before. Right. And you know, I get that at least when I go dredging up some Ugaritic legend or something and saying, oh, see, this explains this icon, you know."},{"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","start":728.73,"end":734.49,"text":"And by the way, wait, what is Ugaritic? Is one one of the obscure languages that Father Steve knows how to read."},{"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","start":735.05,"end":794.99,"text":"It's, it's super helpful if we ever get a time machine. And I can go back to like 1500 B.C. but you know, and it's important to recognize that the, the one of the things, as you just mentioned, once some, you read something or someone tips you off to these things, you start seeing them in iconography, you start hearing them in the hymns of the church, like they're everywhere. It's just we haven't been taught to sort of think in that way and think in that direction. So our orthodox tradition has sort of preserved all of these data points, has preserved all of this information and all of this context for us. It's just we haven't necessarily, as English speaking orthodox Christians in the west, sort of fully appropriated how to connect those dots and how it all fits together and what the connective tissue is between these different things, between this biblical passage and this icon and this hymn."},{"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","start":795.55,"end":964.42,"text":"Yeah. And I think that, you know, as people living in the west, we tend to value education a great deal. And so this is one of the places where a godly education. Right. An appropriately spiritually formed education, can really be helpful to us. Right. So we're not talking about academia in all the negative ways that people tend to use that term. Right. It's not about ripping apart the tradition or destroying what people believe or anything like that, but actually using all kinds of great tools of study that show us, as you said, the connective tissue between things that are right there in our tradition. So the question is not should this be in our tradition, but why is it there and how does it connect with all this other stuff? You know, So I think people are going to be delighted and really excited and interested in a lot of the stuff that we're going to be talking about. And in many ways, you're never going to be able to see the Bible in the same way again. Like, I remember the time you told me that the book of Joshua was about giants. I was like, wait, what? What. What about giants? You know, And I was just really excited to hear that, you know, and that's one of the books that a lot of people never want, don't want to read because they feel like it's a book about genocide, you know, and we're not going to talk, you know, this is not the giants episode, but there is going to be a giants episode. So, yeah, giants and dragons and all these things are in the scripture and in our tradition. And so the question is, what do we do with that and how do we understand what it means, and then how do we best live in that reality? You know, you don't want to open up boxes that you shouldn't open. But there's also just a reality of spirit, a spiritual reality that's. That's there. So, anyway, so I, you know, we want to start our discussion today. As I said, this is. This is an episode about laying the foundations for the rest of what this show is going to be. And we're going to. By the way, we're going to be on twice a month. So the second and fourth Thursday of the month. It's not exactly fortnightly, because occasionally there's going to be five Thursdays in a month. Right. So. But it's going to be the second and fourth Thursdays of the month. And, you know, that's when you're going to be able to tune in live. And it will be available as a podcast for those of you who can't tune in live for whatever reason. You're in a time zone that's halfway across the world or you have something going on. Right. But I wanted to start with this discussion of the question of materialism. Okay. I think in Christian circles we tend to use the word materialism as a kind of synonym for greed. Right. You know, that person is very materialistic, they want to buy a lot of stuff, they're obsessed with their stuff. But that's not what we mean by materialism in what we're talking about. So if you had to give a nutshell definition of materialism, Father, what would you say?"},{"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","start":966.26,"end":976.43,"text":"It's basically the belief that matter and energy and their co relationships and interactions are all that exists."},{"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","start":977.71,"end":981.11,"text":"Right.

It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

It has left a lot of people perplexed, wondering what this could mean, if it means anything. And so I want to look at Asterix comics in general, and this one in particular, to see how this actually makes total sense. That it's in this comic book that we would have seen a strange prophecy of what is happening today. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world. Now, Asterix is one of the most famous European comic books. A lot of people are not aware of that in the United States because Americans don't interact much with other cultures. But when I was young, as a French speaking French Canadian, I read Asterix comics all the time. And what's interesting in Asterix comics is that it is really about what is happening today. There is a lot of stuff in there which is dealing with the problem of Europe, for example, the problem of globalism. Because the story of Asterix is about a Gaul 50 years before Christ, in the time when Julius Caesar was expanding the Roman. The beginning of the Roman Empire and he's taken over Gaul. But there is one village in Gaul that is resisting and it is Asterix's village. Most of the stories revolve around how these Gaul village resist the Roman power, how they're fighting the Romans, how the Romans tried to take them over through different strategies, through infiltration, through all, through giving them a lot of money, you know, giving them a lot of financial opportunities, all kinds of strategies and that they will find in order to finally invade this Gaul village. But the village has a secret potion which is made by a druid, which gives them invulnerability and therefore helps them to resist the Roman Empire. Now of course, we can understand that the whole comic book is about identity and the problem of identity and the problem of a system, a government which would try to include everything and not leave room for an exception, not leave room also for other smaller identities to exist within the within in relationship to the bigger one. To at least have all those identities be included in the big empire rather than have it on the outside. And so the Gauls are like a little, are like an annoyance to Julius Caesar. He's always annoyed to think about the fact that he was not able to take over all of Gaul. There is this remainder on the side which continues to bother him. So he always wants to Include all of it. Now you can see how it can be related to questions of identity in general, questions of borders, questions of exceptions, question also of marginal identities within the empire. All of these ideas are floating around. National identities as well are being dealt with in the story of Asterix. But in this particular comic, what we have is because the Roman Empire, the comic, to be honest, is not particularly good. The story is rather mediocre. But the tenets of the story are interesting to think about in terms of what is happening to us today. And so in the Roman Senate, they realize that there is a deficiency in Rome, that the Roman roads are full of, of potholes and that the Roman roads are. Need to be repaired. And the person who's responsible for that is decadent and is, you know, is always going to orgies and is not, and is not doing his job. And in order to kind of mask that or to, to look over, so that people look over his deficiency, he calls upon having a trans Italic race, a race across all of Italy in which all peoples can be involved. And this will prove the superiority of the Roman roads because they're going to have the race on the Roman roads. But not only that, they also want a Roman to win this race so that Rome is glorified as the race is happening. And so the person who is wearing, who is going to run for the Romans is wearing a mask, a golden mask with a smile on it. And his name is Coronavirus. And his assistant on the chariot is Bacillus, which is also a bacteria that, you know, it's a form of bacteria. And so you have this virus and this bacteria as the Roman race. And the person, the character hidden behind the mask, you know, is the Roman soldier. So we don't know who it is. Now the whole thing takes on all kinds of, you know, all kinds of turns and twists and turns that aren't particularly that interesting. But one of the interesting aspects is that in the race you have all these different cultures. You have these two women from the kingdom of Kush who are kind of Ethiopian African looking. And then you have different peoples of Europe, Egyptians and, you know, Phoenicians and the Goths and all these, and the Russians are there as well. You have all these different, these different nationalities who are racing against Coronavirus. And secretly you find out that Coronavirus is actually cheating. The reason why he's winning is because every day they swap the horses and they give them new horses. And so Coronavirus is winning. And so in order to stop them, to stop coronavirus, they have to band together. All these different peoples have to band together in order to fight the coronavirus. So what's interesting the story, like I said, it's not that particularly interesting, but what I want to point attention to is the elements of the story and how all the elements of the story, even though the story plays out one way or another, are the elements of the situation we're dealing with today. When the story ends, we find out that through all kinds of twists and turns, we find out that hiding behind the coronavirus mask is Julius Caesar and that he is the one, in fact, who is trying to finish the race. And he is not able to finish the race because he falls into a pothole and the Gauls win. But in the end, Julius Caesar, for some reason, is happy and he gives the trophy to the Gauls, who then give it to another tribe, and they give to another tribe and they pass the trophy down from tribe to tribe, and in the end, everybody's happy. Diversity and unity, all that stuff that we, that, that people are talking about today. But what's interesting to look at is a few elements. One is the problem of all these different identities who are participating in this race against the coronavirus. The other thing is that hiding behind the coronavirus is the global empire, which is trying to show its glory and which is trying to compensate for. For the potholes which have appeared in its structure and is therefore trying to compensate for that by winning this race. And so, like I said, it's just very fascinating to see how all the elements are there and how even without talking about whose intention, what intention lies behind this epidemic, we can still see the players move and we can still see how the problem of the epidemic of the coronavirus is an opportunity for different things to play out. One of the possibilities of how things are going to play out is going to be in the return to borders and the, the reaffirmation of identities at all levels of reality. From national identities, by closing borders, even closing borders between states in the United States, we're seeing that happen. Closing borders between cities and rural areas. All of these, this closing of borders can end up with a more. A reality which emphasizes identities at different levels. But it is also possible that because of this epidemic, there will be a, a clampdown of power from above and, you know, and a desire to install mechanisms of control the likes of which we have never seen before. And so we need to be attentive to that, as you will see. I will probably be putting out another video about this very soon, about the question of the question of identity and exchange in this. In the problem of the epidemic. And so stay tuned to that. I will be trying to put out videos at least once a week for the next few weeks to deal with some of the issues that are happening. And so thanks everybody for your support and I will see you very soon. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the Symbolic World.

Hi, this is Father Evan Armitas, priest at St. Spirit on Greek Orthodox Church in Loveland, Colorado, and the host of the Ancient Faith Radio Sunday Night Call In Show Orthodoxy Live. I am pleased to announce today the release of my first book for Ancient Faith Publishing titled Toolkit for Spiritual A Practical Guide to Prayer, Fasting and Almsgiving. It seeks to provide a guide to the three basic and primary disciplines of orthodox spirituality. Through these disciplines, Christ opened for us a path that frees us from the disordered way of life that has become normal for many even though their hearts and minds minds tell them otherwise. Please join me in exploring the three legged stool of orthodox spiritual practice, Prayer, fasting and almsgiving. Books now available@store.ancientfaith.com and the title once again is Toolkit for Spiritual Growth. I look forward to sharing it with you. God bless.

And the reason it's used there is that it's a title for God that describes his relationship with the other spiritual beings whom he created. And so it's a way of referring to God in relationship to the heavenly host, the Divine Council, some of these other concepts that we're going to be talking about a lot, not only in this episode, but in a bunch of episodes, and I'm sure in People's Questions, the parallel title that you find more commonly in the Hebrew Bible is Yahweh Sabaoth, which is usually translated Lord Sabaoth.

And I think Alexander was like. And Wendell Berry too. I think probably the answer for a lot of churches is to. Is to build a really beautiful small chapel somewhere, because that does not have the same, you know, the same complications of fire escapes and whatever. Whatever in your main church. And if you're. If your parish isn't ready financially or educationally to build its parish church the right way, at least if these small side chapels off in the country or even just across the street or in a different part of the city can be done, well, that's enough. I think that should be counted as a giant victory. I mean, enough for now. A parish priest is essentially. I mean, besides everything else that he is, he's the mayor of a small village, and he's got to keep that community together. As you said, quoting Maximus, to the extent that it's able, it's possible.
