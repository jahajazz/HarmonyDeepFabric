[Alice] Let's discuss the concept of truth. I believe truth is absolute and universal, like a mountain that stands firm regardless of who observes it.

[Bob] I see truth as more fluid, Alice. It's like a river that changes its course over time. What was true yesterday might not be true tomorrow, and it can appear different depending on where you're standing.

[Charlie] I think you're both partially right. Truth has multiple facets, like a gemstone. The mountain and river metaphors capture different aspects of truth's nature - its permanence and its adaptability.

[Alice] But Charlie, doesn't that lead to relativism? If truth is so malleable, how can we ever be certain of anything?

[Bob] Certainty might be the wrong goal. Maybe truth is more about the journey of understanding than a fixed destination. Like how a river shapes the landscape over time, our understanding of truth evolves.

[Charlie] Exactly! And just as a gemstone's beauty comes from its many facets, truth's richness comes from its complexity. We need both the mountain and the river to understand it fully.
